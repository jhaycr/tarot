"""OpenAI-compatible /audio/speech — the shape Tarotarium has always used.

Behavior here is deliberately byte-identical to the pre-adapter code: the
same URL, the same Bearer header, the same body keys in the same order of
significance. Existing cached audio is addressed by a hash that includes
the request's inputs, so any change here would silently orphan the cache
and re-render every piece (which happened once in v0.11.2 and is audible).

Compatible servers that aren't OpenAI (Kokoro's kokoro-fastapi, LocalAI)
ignore `instructions`, which is why it is sent only when non-empty.
