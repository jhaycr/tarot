"""User registry — the app's record of who exists.

Identity itself still comes from the proxy header (see auth.py); this is a
projection of it, never an authentication source. Rows appear on first sight, so
the registry is complete without anyone provisioning it: authentik's group
membership is already the gate on who can reach the app at all.

Before this existed, "who is a user" was answered three unconnected ways — the
request header, `readings.owner` strings, and directories under data/users/ —
and a username existed only as a side effect of having saved something.
